You come in to the office to find Tammy, your IT co-worker, is gone for the
day on Jury Duty ... again. "It's her fourth day at Jury Duty this month", you
grumble. While she is out, you need to cover her service desk tickets. You
take a sip of office coffee and open the first one. It reads as follows:

    The journalctl on gimli.securecorp.com is being weird. We are trying to
    confirm if the `systemd-journald` process running on Gimli is running in
    the correct SELinux process.

You login to gimli.securecorp.com (this host) to answer their context
question.

Objective:

*  What SELinux process context does systemd-journald run as?
