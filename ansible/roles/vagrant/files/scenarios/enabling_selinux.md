You've learned the wisdom in SELinux and have decided to reject your insecure
ways of the past. You need to enable SELinux on your system. You need to
enable it now. You think to yourself, how did I ever live this long so
insecurely and look towards the sky.

Objectives:

  * Enable SELinux
  * Ensure the file system has the right SELinux labels
