While troubleshooting in an IRC channel, you are asked for the SELinux file
contexts of a few files on saruman.securecorp.com. The normal SELinux girl is
out of the office. She never seems to be around when you have an SELinux
question.

You login to saruman.securecorp.com (this host) and being to look.

Objective:

* What is the file context of the /home/vagrant/.bash_profile file?
* What is the file context of the /etc/passwd file?
* How are these file contexts stored specifically?
