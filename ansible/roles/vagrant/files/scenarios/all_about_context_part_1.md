While troubleshooting in an IRC channel, you are asked for the SELinux file
contexts of a few files. The normal SELinux girl is out of the office. She
never seems to be around when you have an SELinux question.

Objective:

* What is the file context of the /home/vagrant/.bash_history file?
* What is the file context of the /etc/passwd file?
* How are these file contexts stored specifically?
